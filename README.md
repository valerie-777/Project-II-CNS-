This project aims to implement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capabilities in cloud environments using Microsoft Sentinel, with a specific focus on detecting and mitigating threats associated with scheduled tasks. As businesses increasingly rely on Microsoft Azure for critical services and infrastructure, the risk posed by malicious actors exploiting scheduled tasks to execute persistent threats becomes a significant concern. This study involves creating a scheduled task that mimics an attack, which will create a baseline of distinguishing between benign and malicious scheduled tasks and implementing an automated mitigation strategy using Azure Sentinel. By leveraging Sentinelâ€™s analytics and automated response features, the project seeks to improve threat detection accuracy, minimize false positives, and ensure the prompt isolation of compromised virtual machines (VMs). The proposed solution aims to provide a framework for improving cloud security in Azure environments, thereby protecting organizations from potential data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage.
